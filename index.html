          <h2>Hartford-Region Public Schools and Per-Student Spending Overview </h2>
          <p class="lead">Is there a relationship between Hartford-Region public schools and their student spending? </p>

          <p>This will be where my updated introduction paragraph goes. It is empty right now because I am rewording and making edits so that it gives a more neutral and direct overview</p>

          <p>Although this introduction paragraph is lacking my visualizations and data are not. As seen in <b> Figure 1 </b>, I have organized all Hartford Public Schools by their specific type and I have averaged the per-student spending for each type. Figure 1, shows that there are 4 different public school types but in my next version their will be an additional "Other Mganet School" Category which will increase the total types to 5.</p>

          <p> I will be overviewing the 10 different funding formulas that CT uses to fund their schools. I would like to show the School and State Finance Project pictures to give some context and visual exmaples to help the readers better understand.<p>

          <h2>Current State of Per-Student Spending </h2>
          <p>This paragraph is where I will walk my readers through what <b> Figure 1 </b> is showing. I will also be bringing in outside research to help support speculations that can be made for the data. My first sentence will be something like... CREC Magent schools and Neighborhood schools spent the most per student in 2021 in comparison to HPS Magnet schools and Charter schools as seen below in <b> Figure 1 </b>.</p>

          <h2> Looking Back at The Past </h2>
          <p>In <b> Figure 2</b>, we see the past 4 years of per-student spending by school type. We can see that Neighborhood schools see a dramatic increase in from SYE 2019 to SYE 2020. <b> Figure 2 </b>will need to be annotated so that the Pandemic is noted on the time line. It is spectulated that COVID relief funding (<a href="https://schoolstatefinance.org/issues/esser-funding#:~:text=ESSER%20I%20(CARES%20Act)&text=The%20CARES%20Act%20provided%20%2454.3,which%20Connecticut%20received%20%24111%20million">“COVID-19 Relief Funding for Education.”</a>) contributed to the massive increase in per-stdudent funding experienced by nieghborhood schools.</p>

          <h2> Process and Cautions </h2>

        <p> These visualizations were created with data collected from <a href="https://public-edsight.ct.gov/?language=en_US">EdSight </a>, Connecticut State Government’s Database for educational data. All schools within the Hartford region were grouped by type and matched with EdSight data to find each individual school’s per-student spending. To find per-student spending by type, all of the schools were grouped by their type. Then within each type the per-student spending total amounts from each school were summed and averaged. This provided the average per-student spending by type. The values in the visualizations are averages. There are cases where a magnet school or charter school may be spending significantly more per student than a traditional public school. While Edsight is a reliable source it is not fully comprehensive. Throughout my data collection, several schools and types of schools were missing. While <b> Figure 1 </b> and <b> Figure 2 </b> show four types: CREC magnet, neighborhood, HPS magnet and charter, these are not the only school types Hartford region students can choose from. There are three technical high schools in the Hartford region focusing on vocational and technical education. They are a part of the Connecticut Technical Education and Career System (<a href="https://www.cttech.org/">CTECS</a>) which is not included in the Edsight data. As of 2017, these schools have begun to transisition away from the Connecticut State Department of Education (Connecticut’s Technical Education). Instead the CTECS is is set to become its “executive branch agency” (Connecticut’s Technical Education) in 2023. This is most likely why they are not included in the EdSight database. These technical schools are also not funded in the same way that neighborhood, magnet and charter schools are. They do not receive funding through the Education Cost Sharing formula and instead are “state-operated and funded out of the resources of the State of Connecticut’s General Fund" (Connecticut’s Technical Education). CTECS per-student expenditures are also calculated in a different way than other public schools. Teacher retirement and other additional expenses are included in this student spending figure. With no effective way to extract the pure per-student amount away from the total, technical schools will not be considered for this data story.
        </p>

        <p> Special needs schools were also not included in the EdSight data. It is noted in the data that “all amounts include regular and special education” (“Per Pupil Expenditures”). Some of the special needs spending may be wrapped up in the same value as the regular education spending for a particular school. All of the special needs schools are a part of the Capitol Region Education District except for the iGOAL 1 - Breakthrough Magnet School, North. It is considered a magnet school but has a specialized program for special needs students. While there was data for Breakthrough Magnet School, there was not specific data for the iGOAL 1 school. It is possible the special need spending is also included in the regular school value.</p>

        <p> School codes were used for matching Hartford region schools to the data from EdSight. This means that even if a school’s name were written differently or had changed, the data would still be retrieved. Several schools have special programs within them, for example, “iGOAL 2 - Kennelly School.” These special programs contain a different school code than the school they are associated with. This differentiates them as a separate or different school. Data for these types of schools was not found but data for their associated school was. To continue the example, data for the iGOAL 2 - Kennelly School was not found but data for just the Kennelly School was available. A majority of the unmatched special program schools were neighborhood public schools. These unmatched schools included several Pre-K, RISE and iGOAL schools. The Hartford Public High School also did not have data for all 4 years as in SYE 2018 and SYE 2019 it was split between three different school codes and names like HPHS Engineering and Green Technology Academy, HPHS Law and Government Academy and HPHS Nursing and Health Sciences Academy. These discrepancies are why in visualization 1 it is reported that only 47% of the neighborhood schools in the region were surveyed. See <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYl8OFJ7O3q4NmT3dRywpxtS2B6ie6UpqUWtBKxBfXg/edit?usp=sharing'>"Notes for PPE Data"</a> for a full comprehensive list of schools and types that were not included due to insufficient data. While matching data using school codes allows for name changes and differing spelling, this method is not 100% effective with catching changes in schools. In the coming weeks more research will be done on these special school cases to see if they are separately funded schools and if specific student spending data is available for them.
